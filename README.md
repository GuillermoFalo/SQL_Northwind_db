# Northwind SQL Business Analysis Project

## üìå Project Description

This project presents a structured and analytical approach to solving real-world business questions using the **Northwind sample database**. Designed as a professional exercise, the goal is to replicate the kind of requests a data analyst might receive from a manager or stakeholder in a trading company environment. The project is implemented entirely using SQL queries, run on SQLite3.

## üß† Background and Context

The **Northwind database** simulates the operations of a small international trading company. It contains data related to products, orders, suppliers, customers, employees, and shipping. The database is commonly used in the industry for teaching and testing SQL skills because of its relational structure and realistic business scenario.

This analysis is framed as if the data team has been approached by a manager with a series of business concerns. The goal is to derive insights, generate operational reports, and answer strategic questions that support decision-making across departments such as sales, logistics, and customer service.

## ‚ùì Business Challenges Addressed

The project is structured around 25 business-driven questions categorized by complexity:

- **Basic Requests (10)**: Inventory reports, customer listings, shipping data, and staff details.
- **Intermediate Challenges (10)**: Revenue calculations, performance metrics, customer behavior, and category-level breakdowns.
- **Advanced Analysis (5)**: Ranking and window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), time-series analysis, and identifying gaps in product usage.

These questions simulate day-to-day needs that would typically be assigned to a junior or mid-level data analyst in a real organization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools, Techniques & Skills Applied

To solve these challenges, the following tools and techniques were employed:

- **SQL (SQLite3 dialect)**
  - Multi-table JOINs
  - Aggregation functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
  - Conditional logic with `CASE`
  - Subqueries
  - **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**
  - **Window functions** (`RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`)
- **Schema understanding** and table relationship mapping
- **Query optimization** for performance and clarity
- **Documentation** of queries for reproducibility and review

All queries are organized, commented, and stored in a single `.sql` file in this repository.

## üìò What We Learned

Through this project, we reinforced and advanced our SQL skills while applying them to a realistic business context. Key learnings include:

- Translating vague or general business questions into clear data queries
- Navigating a complex relational schema to identify the correct data sources
- Applying advanced SQL techniques such as CTEs and window functions to extract deeper insights
- Writing clean, maintainable SQL scripts suitable for stakeholder review or team collaboration
- Structuring project deliverables (like this README) for professional presentation on GitHub

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to drive business intelligence by answering practical questions rooted in company operations. It showcases not only technical proficiency, but also an understanding of business needs, communication clarity, and attention to detail in data reporting.

By simulating real workplace tasks, this repository provides a comprehensive example of what an entry- to mid-level data analyst might contribute to a team ‚Äî turning raw data into actionable insights.
